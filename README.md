# VFE - S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Pack - B41 Unofficial Finish

An attempt to unofficially finish the mod "VFE - S.T.A.L.K.E.R Pack" by STENDO_CLIP. Rest in peace!

Treat this as a closure to the mod for B41. I'm not sure if his friend will continue this mod for B42, but this mod will strictly be for B41 only.

There is an existing mod called "VFE STALKER PACK Complete", but it adds stuff such as increased durability that I don't want to include. I want this mod to stay true to the original vision of "VFE - S.T.A.L.K.E.R Pack".

## Features

- Add Packs, Cases and Crates for the new ammunition introduced by the mod.
- Modified loot tables so that Packs, Cases and Crates for ammo introduced by the mod spawn in the world.
- Added VSS shooting sound using the same sound as MP5SD.
- Modify loot table so that it matches the original VFE. Every gun from "VFE - S.T.A.L.K.E.R Pack" should be able to spawn in the world now.
